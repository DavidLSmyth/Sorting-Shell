These are the necessary files to run a Java Sorting Shell.
Each of the sorting algorithms were written first according to the interface SortingAlgorithms.java
The .java files with the word test in them are for unit testing.
Once the sorting algorithms obey the interface and pass the unit tests, then sort.java can be run
sort.java is the file that runs the shell. 
The commands for the shell are:

1).   >>> load <algorithm name>
This loads a sorting algorithm into the shell environment

2).   >>> tag <algorithm name> <new name>
This renames the algorithm in the shell environment

3).   >>> quit 
This exits the shell

4).   >>> sort <algorithm name> <input file name> <output file name>
This sorts a text file using the specified algorithm and writes the text file to an ouput file

5).   >>> unload <algorithm name>
This unloads the specified algorithm from the shell environment


Bubblesort, Heap, Merge, InsertionSort and Quick and the algorithms that should be used in the shell. 

There are a lots of improvements that can be made to this program, it was written as an introduction to Java
