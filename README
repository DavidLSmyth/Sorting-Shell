I have included JUnit test cases to show that the sorting algorithms work according to the interface. I have also included a file named data.txt which can be used to with
sort command in the sort class. The program should start with the sort class. The keywords load, sort, tag unload and quit may be used when the programming is running.
The classes that I have written that can be loaded are Bubblesort, Heap, Merge, InsertionSort and Quick. To run the program, run the sort class and then use the commands
specified above.
